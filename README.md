# Why?

💀 **Dead simple** - you can learn it from single code example, zero magic code

⏱ **Lightweight and very fast** - very simple in design, without any library compilers that you will never use,  you can't found here **SuperDuperCSS** and **SomeAwesomeHTML** because you know better what you want

🧩 **Modular** - you can even override some used libraries if you need to, but without that you need at least prepare your favorite languages/compilers etc.

📐 **Ready to use** - just add to your project, create file and prepare your first task

🔌 **Extendable** - you are owner of your flow, without any magic and invisible parts/configurations etc.

🌏 **Shareable** - you can easly share your flow for whole team or for unknown people across internet
